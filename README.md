# Interactive-Registration-Form
This is an interactive registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a fictional Full Stack conference. This project is meant to display my skills of adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity and implementing user input validation and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
